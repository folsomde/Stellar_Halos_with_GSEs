# README
This repository contains supplemental figures for [Folsom et al. (2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02723), "Cosmological Simulations of Stellar Halos with *Gaia* Sausageâ€“Enceladus Analogues." These figures are also available in Appendix C of the preprint, [arXiv:2408.02723](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02723). The images in the folders here correspond to the panels in Figures 4, 5, 6, and 8, with descriptions of the figures provided in the main text. There is one file for each set of radially anisotropic (RA) stellar debris. The files follow the naming convention
```
<N>-<MW ID>[-2].png
```
where `N` indicates the number of mergers contributing to the debris, `MW ID` is the Subfind ID of the Milky Way analogue containing the debris, and the suffix `-2` is added in cases where there are two choices of RA debris (see the manuscript for more details).
